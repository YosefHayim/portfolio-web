# Domain Docs

This is a single-context repo.

## Before Exploring

Read `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root before using engineering skills that depend on domain language, especially `improve-codebase-architecture`, `diagnose`, `tdd`, `to-issues`, `to-prd`, and `zoom-out`.

If `docs/adr/` exists, read ADRs that touch the area being changed. If the directory does not exist, proceed silently.

## Current Layout

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── agents/
└── client/
└── server/
└── worker/
```

## Vocabulary

Use the domain terms from `CONTEXT.md` when naming issues, PRDs, refactor proposals, hypotheses, and tests.

If a needed concept is missing from `CONTEXT.md`, treat that as a signal for `grill-with-docs` or a focused docs update rather than inventing parallel vocabulary.

## ADR Conflicts

If future work contradicts an ADR, call it out explicitly and explain why reopening the decision may be worth it.
